# Media Organizer

Media Organizer is a lightweight Java Swing desktop application that helps you organize your media files (photos, videos, etc.) by their creation date. 
It lets you filter files by day, week, or month, and copies them into a new folder on your Desktop, organized into subfolders based on the selected time filter.

## Features


* **Organize by Creation Date:** Automatically sorts your media files into subfolders by the date they were created.
* **Filter by Time Range:** Choose to organize files by day, week, or month.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive GUI for easy interaction and configuration.
* **Non-destructive Copying:** Files are safely copied â€” the original files remain untouched.
* **Batch Processing:** Handle multiple files and directories simultaneously to save time.
* **Cross-Platform:** Runs on any system with Java installed.


## Getting Started
